   Memory architecture of .net applications
   ----------------------------------------

   To understand the CTS, one must have know-how of "How memory is
   reserved (used by TYPES) for CTS?".


   When we launch an application, the .net framework service allocate
   1 MB memory for "local variables", "method arguments", "method    return value" and "method call" -- this 1 MB RAM segment is called    "Stack Frame Memory".


   In case we need more memory to store huge amount of data then we must have to request the .net framework and .net framework will return memory address of allocated region -- this allocated memory is called "Heap frame memory".

   The size of "heap" can be vary from 1 byte to 2 GB or more (depend    upon the RAM chips).

    Note: We will use "new keyword" to request more memory.

     

  Based upon memory usage (as per above mentioned), CTS are falls into   following group (category):

    1. Value Types : TYPES having fixed data size/length are called
		     Value TYPES.

                    In CTS, "structure" and "enum" keyword are used
	            to design "Value Types".

                    So, struct & enum are example of value types.

                    Value Types uses "Stack Frame" as well as "Heap                     Frame" memory.

  2. Reference Types : TYPES having variable data size/length are
                       called "Reference Types".

                       In CTS, "class","interface","array","delegate"
                       are used to create "Reference Types". So, class,
                       interface, array and delegate are example of
                       Reference Types.

                       Reference Types always uses "Heap Frame".


  Simple Types (Primitive)
  ------------------------

  Simple Types are "struct" (ie. they are Value Types) and they are 
  available at "System" namespace.

  Namespace is just like a "package" in Java. Java's root package name is 'java' whereas .net framework's root namespace(package) name is  'System'.

  ------ What is namespace? ------------------
  |  A namespace (package) is tecnique to create a group of related
     classes and keep one group of classes distict from another group
     of classes to avoid name-mangling ( duplicate).

   
  CTS Name		C# alias(second name)		Size(bytes) ====================================================================
 System.Byte		byte  (unsigned)  		1
 System.SByte		sbyte (signed)			1

 System.Int16		short	(signed)		2
 System.UInt16		ushort (unsigned)		2

 System.Int32		int (signed)			4
 System.UInt32		uint (unsigned)			4

 System.Int64		long(signed)			8
 System.UInt64		ulong(unsigned)			8
  
    [Byte, Int16, Int32, Int64 are integer family members]


 System.Single		float				4
 System.Double		double				8
 System.Decimal		decimal				14

    [float, double & decimal are real type family members]

 System.Char		char				2
			character represent unicode character-set
                        also called UTF - Universal text format 
                        or National character set.

                        UTF allow us to represent char-set of 
                        different langauges including English,
			Hindi, Gujarati and so on.

			DBMS systems (oracle, MySql, MSSQL, DB2 etc)
 			uses nchar, nvarchar, nvarchar2, ntext
			datatypes.

 System.Bool		bool				1 (bit)
			Value true or false is used.

 System.DateTime	System.DateTime			8
