The .Net Framework
=====================================================================
 
  What is a "framework" or "platform"?

    The framewor/platform is a computing environment through which
    we can develop, deploy and execute applications in highly 
    distributed environement of the Internet (network).

    Distributed Computing  / Client-server computing : 

       To split the process (program) into two or more processes        (applications) and these processes will be communicate
       with each other via evergreen network protocol TCP/IP -- This
       kind of application architecture is known as "Client/Server"
       or "Distributed Computing".

       It is important to note that these processes are exists into
       a single host (machine) or remote host but when they are up,        they will united like a "whole".

       Each running process must have IP-address and unique port        number. The C/S architecture define communication channel via
       IPAddress:port (e/g 127.0.0.1:1500 ) syntax.

       There are 65536 ports for TCP/IP and
                 65536 ports for UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

       Port number is positive integer ranging from 0 to 65535.

       In our operating systems, some of the PORT are reserved for
       standard protcols and internal working. 

             e.g PORT 7 for timer
                 PORT 21 for FTP
                 PORT 80 for HTTP

       Basically platforms are designed using "Holywood principle -        Dont' call us, we will call you". In computing context, this        principle is known as Inversion of Control - IoC.

       Platforms are like "container" of applications and they manages
       them (start, stop, pause, communicate and so on).

  
 What is the .net framework?

       The .net framework is set of services which are started with
       operating system and exposed to us in form of system-level and
       abstracted classes. 

       The .net framework for linux/mac OS is known as "Mono".
       

       Service? It is a program with long life. Long run application.



       The .net framework is open source. We can use, distribute or
       sale our products written on .net framework without any licence         or with open source licence.


       Home of Framework (Win OS)

          X:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Frameworks folder is HOME of
          .net frameworks.

          Current Framework version is 4.5 (previous releases - 4.0,           3.5, 2.0, 1.1, 1.0)
